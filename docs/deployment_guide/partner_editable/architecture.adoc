** One S3 bucket to store prestage and poststage data
** AWS Glue for converting Parquet files and partitioning poststage data.
** An AWS Lake Formation data lake for governance and security.
* Amazon KMS to create, manage, and control cryptographic keys
* Amazon SQS to send, store, and recieve messages for the WFM and TPS services
* Amazon SNS to facilitate messaging between the WFM service and subscribed accounts
